## Development

This is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) app, with a SQLite based backend, intended to be run with the LTS version of Node.

To run the development server:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Task:

Modify the code to add support for due dates, image previews, and task dependencies.

### Part 1: Due Dates 

When a new task is created, users should be able to set a due date.

When showing the task list is shown, it must display the due date, and if the date is past the current time, the due date should be in red.

### Part 2: Image Generation 

When a todo is created, search for and display a relevant image to visualize the task to be done. 

To do this, make a request to the [Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/) using the task description as a search query. Display the returned image to the user within the appropriate todo item. While the image is being loaded, indicate a loading state.

You will need to sign up for a free Pexels API key to make the fetch request. 

### Part 3: Task Dependencies

Implement a task dependency system that allows tasks to depend on other tasks. The system must:

1. Allow tasks to have multiple dependencies
2. Prevent circular dependencies
3. Show the critical path
4. Calculate the earliest possible start date for each task based on its dependencies
5. Visualize the dependency graph

## Submission:
