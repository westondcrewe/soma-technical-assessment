Part 1: Due Dates
When a new task is created, users should be able to set a due date.

When showing the task list is shown, it must display the due date, and if the date is past the current time, the due date should be in red.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I have:
-calendar on todo creation component for due date setting
Need to:
-Add "due_date" field to table schema - what type? string? datetime? figure out. probably datetime bc createdAt field is datetime. also, make it dueDate, snake not camel it seems is standard
-Connect todo creation component calendar input to database - route POST method handling, handleAddTodo
-Add due date as text on todo component - maybe add a countdown beneath (3 weeks, 4 days)
-Add late effect for due date font (once it turns late, font goes red) - maybe a react hook

Further steps:
-refactor for modularity
-sort itemlist by dueDate
